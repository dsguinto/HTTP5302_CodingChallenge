## Challenge Description
You are to create a “Team Members” page for a website. A data access API endpoint is
provided (second page), but a web client is needed to access the API and render the data onto
a webpage. The initial wireframe is flexible, however, the desktop version for each employee
should look similar to the following layout.

Use only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to complete the task. No helper functions, libraries, or
frameworks are allowed!

### Notes
- The top right “Crown” icon should only be displayed if the employee is featured
- Each “role” is given a corresponding color
- Images for employees can be found in
